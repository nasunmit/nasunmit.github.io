# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Manolis Kellis](http://mit.edu/manoli/). [[Kellis Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/)]
* My research interests lie in the interface between neuroscience, immunology, and machine learning, focusing on developing and applying methods to analyze and understand the multimoics data at the single cell level.
* Before my Ph.D. training at MIT, I worked at [Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard](https://ragoninstitute.org/) as a computational biologist.
